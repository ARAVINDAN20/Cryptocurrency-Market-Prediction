## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ARAVINDAN20/Cryptocurrency-Market-Prediction.git
    cd Cryptocurrency-Market-Prediction
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\env\Scripts\activate

        ```

4. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated.

2. Run the Streamlit GUI:
